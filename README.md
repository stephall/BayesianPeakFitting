This project serves as a showcase for the use of Bayesian inference in peak fitting and is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.

An example, where two peaks have to be fitted, can be found in the Jupyter Notebook "DoublePeakFitting.ipynb".
One could modify this example using a hyper-prior distributions for the Full Width at Half Maximum parameters of both peaks.
